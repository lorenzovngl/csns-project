# Simulation of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in NetLogo

Description of the project

The project starts from studying the model [Virus](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Virus) from the NetLogo library and then adding an infection tracing method and a contact tracing method: during the simulation a tree and a graph will be built which represent the paths that compose the outbreak.
The Virus model is a SIR model and will be transformed in a SEIQJR model beacause we want to represent what has happened with the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic.
Among the options available four new will be added representing actions that can be carried out on the population:
- Social distance
- Quarantine
- Selected lockdown
- Total lockdown
