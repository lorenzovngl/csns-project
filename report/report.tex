\begin{abstract}
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak forced the world population to face a new disease for which there was not a vaccine and governments had to use some alternative actions to limit the virus spreading. Predicting the impact of an action on the population is very important before making it effective and we need mathematical models to do that. This paper shows the implementation of a virus outbreak in NetLogo and it provides actions to limit the spreading: quarantine, isolation, social distance and lockdown. Every action can be enable or disable and it has parameters that can be set. A study on how these actions can help to fight and slow down the virus propagation is described and results that prove the effectiveness of these containment measures are shown.

\section{Introduction}
This paper describes the process to build and study a network model that simulates the outbreak of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus using NetLogo. In addition, the model provides methods to control the spreading. To achieve the challenge, we must consider a situation in which we have a crowd of people that have contacts with each other, where there are some infected individuals that cause the spreading of the infection. Also some kind of quarantine and isolations are needed for who become infected. Finally we need some population-size actions like social distancing and lockdown, beacause these are the most used and effective actions that have been used by governments to reduce the impact of the virus on the population.\\
Our model provides all the features mentioned above with different paramaters that can be set in order to set the strenghtness of the containment measures.\\
Once we have found a setting of parameters that causes, more or less, the same effects on the population as the real virus did, we focus our experiments in study the impact of the containment measures on the virus effects on the population. Results we got clearly shows that these actions are effective and can save lives.

\section{Preliminaries}
The literature about virus diffusion is very rich because 2020 has been a year in which the researchers need to discover something about the new SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease \cite{singhal}. Models to represent situations like this or other diseases like flu were developed by Brauer et al. \cite{brauer}; one of these, the SEIQRJ model, is suitable to study the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the population. An article from Giordano et al. explain how to model the intervetions in the population to fight the COVID-19 outbreak \cite{giordano}, but it's too complex for the purposes of this project. The Netlogo \cite{netlogo} models library offers an implementation of the SIR model \cite{netlogo-virus}, it's very simple and general-purpose, but it was a good point to start the implementation of a SEIQJR model.\\ 
In this project, the modelling phase started from the SEIQJR model shown by by Brauer et al. and the implementation phase started from the Virus model from the NetLogo library.

\section{Modeling}
In this section I will explain the process of thinking which models are better to use for the aim of the project and how I modified the ones from \cite{brauer}.

\subsection{The SIS model}
The SIS model is the simplest model in which there is a class of susceptible people ($S$) that, if one get the infection, goes to the infected class ($I$). Then, when infected people get recovered they returned to the susceptible class.

\paragraph{New classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ = Susceptible
\item $I$ = Infected
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{New variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item $a$ = infection rate;
\item $b$ = probability that an infected person get recovered.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw] at (0,0) (S) {\Large $S$};
    \node[draw] at (4,0) (I) {\Large $I$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (S.east) -- (I.west) node [midway,above] {$aSI$};;
    \draw[draw, -latex] (I.east) -| ($(I.east)+(0.5,1)$) -- ($(S.west)+(-0.5,1)$) node [midway,above] {$bI$} |- (S.west);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Diagram of the SIS model}
\end{figure}

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -aSI + bI$$
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = aSI - bI$$

\subsection{The SEIS model}
As we know, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads an incubation period during which the infected person don't have symptoms but can transmit the infection to other people. We introduce an exposed class $E$ in which we put people that had have a contact with infected people and may be infected in an asymptomatic status.

\paragraph{New classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item $E$ = Exposed
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{New variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item $k$ = probability that exposed people become infective.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw] at (0,0) (S) {\Large $S$};
    \node[draw] at (3.5,0) (E) {\Large $E$};
    \node[draw] at (7,0) (I) {\Large $I$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (S.east) -- (E.west) node [midway,above] {$aSI$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (E.east) -- (I.west) node [midway,above] {$kE$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (I.east) -| ($(I.east)+(0.5,1)$) -- ($(S.west)+(-0.5,1)$) node [midway,above] {$bI$} |- (S.west);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Diagram of the SEIS model}
\end{figure}

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -aSI + bI$$
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = aSI - kE$$
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = kE - bI$$

\paragraph{\textbf{No immunity provided}}
Beacuse of the unknown properties of immunity from SARS-CoV-2, we can assume that the S class and R class coincide, creating a cycle that causes the comeback of the recoverd individuals in the susceptible class.

\subsection{The SEIQJS model}
Due to the unavailability of a vaccine, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infected people are quarantined or isolated (or, also, hospitalized). As suggested from the SEIQJR model, two classes were added: $Q$ is the class of quarantined people, i.e. the exposed people belong to the class $E$; $J$ is the class for isolate infected people of class $I$. So basically $Q$ is for $E$ what $J$ is for $I$, with the only difference that there is a flow from $Q$ to $J$ but not vice versa.\\
People isolated (i.e. belong to class $J$) can recover as people belong to class $I$.

\paragraph{New classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q$ = Quarantined
\item $J$ = Isolated
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{New variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\varepsilon_E$ = probability that a person exposed (in $E$) transmit the infection, exposed-transmission-factor;
\item $\varepsilon_Q$ = probability that a person quarantined (in $Q$) make a contact, quarantined-contact-factor;
\item $\varepsilon_J$ = probability that a person isolated (in $J$) transmit the infection, isolation-transmission-factor;
\item $k_E$ = probability that exposed people become infective;
\item $k_Q$ = probability that quarantined people are isolated;
\item $c_Q$ = percentage of exposed people that are quarantined at each time step;
\item $c_J$ = percentage of infected people that are isolated at each time step;
\item $b_I$ = probability that an infected person get recovered;
\item $b_J$ = probability that an isolated person get recovered;
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw] at (0,0) (S) {\Large $S$};
    \node[draw] at (5,1) (E) {\Large $E$};
    \node[draw] at (5,-1) (Q) {\Large $Q$};
    \node[draw] at (7,1) (I) {\Large $I$};
    \node[draw] at (7,-1) (J) {\Large $J$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (S.north) |- (E.west) node [midway,xshift=2cm,above] {$aS(\varepsilon_EE + \varepsilon_E\varepsilon_QQ + \varepsilon_JJ)$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (E.south) -- (Q.north) node [midway,left] {$c_QE$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (E.east) -- (I.west) node [midway,above] {$k_EE$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (I.south) -- (J.north) node [midway,left] {$c_JI$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (Q.east) -- (J.west) node [midway,above] {$k_QQ$};
    \draw[draw, -latex] (I.east) -| ($(I.east)+(0.5,1)$) -- ($(S.west)+(-0.5,2)$) node [midway,above] {$b_II$} |- ($(S.west)+(0,0.1)$);
    \draw[draw, -latex] (J.east) -| ($(J.east)+(0.5,-1)$) -- ($(S.west)-(0.5,2)$) node [midway,above] {$b_JJ$} |- ($(S.west)-(0,0.1)$);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Diagram of the SEIQJS model}
\end{figure}

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -aS(\varepsilon_EE + \varepsilon_E\varepsilon_QQ + \varepsilon_JJ) + b_II + b_JJ$$
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = aS(\varepsilon_EE + \varepsilon_E\varepsilon_QQ + \varepsilon_JJ) - (k_E + c_Q)E$$
$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = c_QE - k_QQ$$
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = k_EE - (b_I + c_J)I$$
$$\frac{dJ}{dt} = k_QQ + c_JI - b_JJ$$

\subsection{Action to limit the epidemic spread}
In a context of epidemic spread some actions can carried on to protect the health of the population. Basically, because of the virus infection is transmitted during contacts person-to-person, these contacts must be reduced. Putting the exposed or infected people in quarantine or isolation is the best thing to do, but also methods of social distancing or mobility restrictions can be used. \\
In this project I implemented quarantine, isolation, social distance and lockdown.

\subsection{Contact tracing and evaluation method}
As we know that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an asymptomatic status, a contact tracing technique can be used to find people who can transmit the virus before that they become symptomatic. In this model I built a contact tracing technique not properly to find potential infected individuals, but to evaluate the amount of contacts in each simulation to have an indicator of the power of the spreading. What is important to notice is that the more contacts we have between people, the more powerfull the outbreak will be and thus the harder will be to control it.

\section{Implementation}
In this section I describe the way I implemented the concepts shown in the previous section.

\subsection{The base model}
The Virus model from the NetLogo library \cite{netlogo-virus} is the point from which I started the development of my model. The Virus model is an implementation of the SIR model, with some peculiarities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item people can reproduce;
\item people can recover from the infection but they can also die;
\item recovered individuals have a phase of immunity before they come back to the susceptible class.
\end{enumerate}
I conclude that these three characteristics have no interest to be in my final model, so I edited this model to have the following situation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item people cannot reproduce because the epidemic spread is as fast as we can ignore the machanism of reproduction in the population;
\item people can only recover from the infection and they cannot die;
\item recovered individuals have no phase of immunity beacuse, for SARS-CoV-2, we don't have clear informations.
\end{enumerate}
Once I have a SIR model is easy to transform it to a SIS model: the only thing to do is put the flow that previously went to the recovered class ($R$) in the susceptible class ($S$).\\
After this editing I basically my final model will be an enrichment of this model.

\subsection{Parameters}
The parameters of the model are the ones described for the SEIQJS model, divided into fixed parameters, i.e. the ones that are specific to the virus, and the control parameters, which can be tuned in order to study attempts to manage the epidemic.

\paragraph{Fixed parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{infection-rate} ($a$);
\item \texttt{exposed-transmission-factor} ($\varepsilon_E$);
\item \texttt{exposed-to-infected-rate} ($k_E$);
\item \texttt{quarantined-to-isolated-rate} ($k_Q$);
\item \texttt{infected-chance-recover} ($b_I$);
\item \texttt{isolated-chance-recover} ($b_J$).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Control parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{quarantine-perfection-rate} ($\varepsilon_Q$);
\item \texttt{quarantine-perfection-rate} ($\varepsilon_J$);
\item \texttt{quarantines-per-tick-rate} ($c_Q$);
\item \texttt{isolations-per-tick-rate} ($c_J$).
\end{itemize}

Experiments with this model are made by trying different values for control parameters, while fixed parameters remain unchanged.

\subsection{Class representation}
The SIS, SEIS and other similar diagrams have a fundamental constraint: at each time step, a person of the population (i.e. an agent) must belong to one and only one class. This is done by simply add five properities to the agent: one of each indicates a different class, so at each time step, one of these property must be true and the others false.

\subsection{Class transitions methods}
To make possible that a person change class a series of methods were implemented. All of them share a similar structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item check if the candidate that is going to go to the class actually belongs to a class from which a flow from the two classes is defined (throw an error if not);
\item put to \textit{false} the properties of the person that could hold the value \textit{true};
\item put to \textit{true} the property that indicates the new class.
\end{enumerate}
These methods are \texttt{get-exposed}, \texttt{get-quarantined}, \texttt{get-infected}, \texttt{get-isolated} and \texttt{get-recovered}.

\subsection{Core procedures: setup and go}
Every NetLogo model is based on these two procedures:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{setup} is the function that provides the initialization of the model before every simulation;
\item \texttt{go} is the function that will be executed every time step (tick).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The procedure \texttt{setup}} creates the turtles that represent the population and initialize their properties: every turtle is putted in the susceptible class. To create the beginning of virus spreading, after these actions some of the created turtles are picked at random and moved to the exposed class and to the infected class.\\

To understand the explaination of the following procedure \texttt{go} I need to underline first a design choice: I decided to let that some actions occurs more often that others, below I explain which they are an why. To implement this behaviour I used a new variable that counts the days elapsed from the beginning of the simulation, every time \texttt{ticks} is a multiplier of \texttt{ticks-per-days}, days counter advances.\\

\paragraph{The procedure \texttt{go}} calls various other procedures that carried on the simulation and the behaviour of the model, but they are divided into two groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{once-per-tick} procedures that are called every time the \texttt{go} procedure is called, so every tick
\begin{itemize}
\item people motion in the enviroment, 
\item people transition to exposed class due to a contact with an infected person,
\item contract tracing update;
\end{itemize}
\item \textit{once-per-day} procedures that are called every time the days counter advanced:
\begin{itemize}
\item every class transition except the one from susceptible to exposed, that, as I said previously, happens for every tick.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Virus propagation}
The infection spreading of the virus in the population is implemented in the function \texttt{infect} that looks a little bit complicated but, essentialy, uses the parameters of the model call, in a proper way, the procedure \texttt{get\_exposed}. It's the only procedure that makes call to \texttt{get\_exposed}. Take a look to the comments in the code of the model to know more.

\subsection{Contact tracing}
Contact tracing is implemented using the construct \texttt{link} of NetLogo. Ar each time step, the program asks to each person to create a link with other people that share, in that moment, the same patch. Basically is the same way that the virus spreads and it has a sense beacuse the aim of contact tracing is to track the propagation of the virus. The result is a graph connecting people to each others.

\subsection{Social distance and lockdown}
Two methods were implemented to control people movement in order to reduce contacts between them: social distance and lockdown
\paragraph{Social distance} can be enabled or disabled in this model and uses an auxiliry parameter called \texttt{social-distance-perfection-rate}. If social distance is disabled, people are free to move everywhere, while if it's enabled people avoid to move to a patch that is already occupied by others with an error probability of determined by $1 - \textrm{\texttt{social-distance-perfection-rate}}$.
\paragraph{Lockdown} is implemented taking into account a value that defines the probability that a person will move or not. If the variable \texttt{lockdown-strinctness} is set to zero, people are completely free to move, while if the value increases, people will make a move with less probability. If a person doesn't move, it remain in the same patch where it was previously.\\ \\
Take a look to the procedure \texttt{move} to find the code about these control measures.


\subsection{Evaluation}
In this model I consider to evaluate every situation analyzing the graph generate by the contact tracing method. The more connected is the graph, the more powerful is the virus spreading and so, in a real situation, the more stressed the health system will be.\\
I use the definition of \textit{degree centrality} to have a clear indicator of the connections that each person create during simulation. Beacause of degree centrality is a node-based measure, I used the average of all the degree centrality to get a value to evaluate the entire graph. An auxiliary indicator of standard deviation for this average is provided. \\
If a control action on the population reduces the value of \textit{average degree centrality}, it means that the action is effective.

\section{Results}\label{results}
In this section I describe the results obtained making simulations with this model. Differences between simulations are about managing control parameters in order to watch how the simulation evolves with different actions.\\
The size of the population at the beginning of the simulation is fixed at 150 and the duration of the simulation is 365 days.

\subsection{Virus diffusion without actions}
The first thing to do to have an idea of what happens is to watch the behavior of the model if nothing action to fight the virus is taken. As we can see in fig. \ref{fig:noactions-a} the lethality of the virus makes an unacceptable impact on the population, reducing it to few individuals. The reduction of the \textit{average degree centrality} (fig. \ref{fig:noactions-b}) is only due to the decrease of the population.

\begin{figure}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Result of the simulations without actions to control the diffusion of the virus. Population has been reduced by \textbf{96\%} and \textbf{147} people were dead.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using only quarantine and isolation}
Let's see how using quarantine and isolation will change the virus diffusion and thus the results after a simulation. These measure prevent the people to move but not to making contacts, even if with a lower probability. We can see in fig. \ref{fig:quar-isol-a} the huge impact that these measures make in the simulation, saving the 29,3\% of the population with respect to the previous situation. In fig. \ref{fig:noactions-b} we can se a visible reduction of contacts between people. Simulation is carried out with these settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{quarantine-perfection-rate} = 70
\item \texttt{quarantines-per-day-rate} = 10
\item \texttt{isolation-perfection-rate} = 90
\item \texttt{isolations-per-day-rate} = 10
\end{itemize}

	\draw [->] (label.west) -| (-3.2,-0.50);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    }
		\caption{Evolution of the population divided by class.} \label{fig:quar-isol-b}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Result of the simulations where on the 100\textsuperscript{th} day quarantine and isolation has been activated for exposed and infected. Population has been reduced by \textbf{66.7\%} and \textbf{122} people were dead.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using only social distance and lockdown}
Before combining all the control measures available, let's see the impact of social distance and lockdown. In the graph of population in \ref{fig:dist-lock-a} the effect is not particularly noticeable, but as we can see in \ref{fig:dist-lock-b} there is an immediate drop of the number of contacts when social distance is activated. A similar thing happend with the activation of lockdown. Simulation is carried out with these settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{social-distance-perfection-rate} = 70
\item \texttt{lockdown-strictness} = 90
\end{itemize}

Result shows if there is the need to choose to use quarantine and isolation or social distance and lockdown, the first option is the best beacause is able to save more lives.

\begin{figure}
		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Combining quarantine and isolation with social distance and lockdown}
Finally, let's see what happens if all these measures are activated progressively. Fig. \ref{fig:comb} shows the final results: after the year elapsed in the simulation, the population number is higher and the number of deaths is lower with respect to the previous experiments. We can notice in this case something that didn't happens before: the population is able to come back to grow.

\section{Conclusions}
The model shown in this paper represents a pretty accurate simulation to reproduce the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and results shows that the actions that were carried out in the real world to fight this virus are effective also in this model. Each of the possibile action that can be used (quarantine, isolation, social distance, lockdown) bring benefits to the final results and, if all of them are used toghether, the results are even better.

\subsection*{Further directions}
Two interesting things can be done to carry on this work. The first if to try different setting of the parameters to watch how a change in a parameter value changes the behavior of the model; the second is related to the first and is about to find possible tipping point, i.e. when a little change in a parameter caused a big change in the simulation.
